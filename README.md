This app fits a specific need for a special company in Senegal : [La Laiterie du Berger](https://www.gca-foundation.org/en/organisation/laiterie-du-berger/), which enables 600 herders families to have regular revenue by purchasing their milk. Collectors on motorbikes follow nomad cattles, meet herders and gather milk. They need to make sure that each flock is registered under the right herders' account.
